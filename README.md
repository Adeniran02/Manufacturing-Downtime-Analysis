# Manufacturing Downtime Analysis
Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project explores the root causes and performance patterns behind manufacturing downtime using a real-world dataset from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/). Built in Power BI, the dashboard blends executive-level insights with granular root cause analysis — designed to help teams make smarter, faster decisions.

## Why I Built This
I stumbled on the dataset during a quiet moment in the week and couldn’t resist diving in. As someone actively seeking an entry-level data role, I’ve been building projects that showcase not just my technical skills, but my ability to tell clear, human-centered stories with data. This dashboard is part of that journey.

## Dashboard Structure

### 🔹 Page 1: Performance Snapshot
![Performance Snapshot](assets/performance_snapshot.png)
- **Total Downtime**, **Line Efficiency**, and **Operator Error Rate**
- Downtime trends by **hourly range** and **reason**
- Operator performance by **shift**
- Line efficiency tracked across **batches**

### 🔹 Page 2: Root Cause Analysis
![Root Cause Analysis](assets/root_cause_analysis.png)
- Top downtime factors driving **60% of impact**
- Heatmap of downtime by **hour and day**
- Operator-level breakdown of downtime causes
- Batch-level table showing **downtime type**, **count**, and **hour range**

## Key Insights
- **Afternoons**, especially **Mondays and Fridays**, show peak downtime
- **Machine adjustment**, **failure**, and **inventory shortage** are the top 3 causes
- Operator-level patterns reveal targeted opportunities for training and process improvement

## Features
- 📈 Interactive visuals with storytelling annotations
- 🎨 Custom green-themed palette for visual cohesion
- 🧠 Designed for both executive review and operational deep dives

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX for calculated columns and measures
- GitHub for versioning and documentation
- Medium for project write-up and methodology
